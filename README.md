# Loan-prediction
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and machine learning modeling for predicting loan approval status using various classification algorithms. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation of multiple machine learning models.


## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build predictive models that can determine whether a loan will be approved or not based on historical data. The dataset used for this analysis is `loan_train.csv`.
The dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikasukani/loan-eligible-dataset


## Data Preprocessing

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values in `Dependents`, `Credit_History`, `Loan_Amount_Term`, and `LoanAmount` were filled with their respective means.
2. **Outlier Removal**: Outliers in `ApplicantIncome`, `CoapplicantIncome`, `LoanAmount`, and `Loan_Amount_Term` were removed using the IQR method.
3. **Binary Transformation**: Columns like `Gender`, `Married`, `Education`, `Self_Employed`, and `Loan_Status` were transformed into binary values.
4. **One-Hot Encoding**: The `Property_Area` column was one-hot encoded.
5. **Resampling**: The SMOTE technique was used to address class imbalance in the target variable.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Distribution plots for `Loan_Status`, `Gender`, and `Education`.
- Histograms for `ApplicantIncome` and `LoanAmount`.
- Boxplot for `ApplicantIncome` by `Education`.
- Pairplot for visualizing relationships between `ApplicantIncome`, `CoapplicantIncome`, `LoanAmount`, `Loan_Amount_Term`, and `Credit_History`.
- Correlation heatmap.
- Interactive scatter plot using Plotly for `ApplicantIncome` vs `LoanAmount` colored by `Loan_Status`.


## Model Training

Various machine learning models were trained:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes


## Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV for the following models:
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Gradient Boosting
- SVM
- KNN
- Naive Bayes

The best parameters were identified and used to retrain the models for optimal performance.


## Evaluation

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.
- Precision: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of the total predicted positives.
- Recall: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of the total actual positives.
- F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
- ROC AUC: Measures the ability of the model to distinguish between classes, with a higher value indicating better performance.

Confusion matrices and ROC curves were plotted for the models with the best parameters to visually represent the performance.

## Conclusion

This project outlines the comprehensive process of developing a machine learning model for loan prediction, encompassing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Both the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers demonstrated strong performance, with high accuracy and AUC scores. Among the models tested, Random Forest emerged as the best-performing classifier.

To further enhance model performance, several strategies could be explored:

- Enhanced Data Preprocessing: Implementing alternative preprocessing techniques could potentially improve the quality of the input data.
- Expanded Hyperparameter Tuning: Enlarging the parameter grid for hyperparameter tuning may yield more optimal configurations, enhancing model performance.
- Feature Engineering: Extracting additional features through advanced feature engineering could provide the model with more informative inputs.
- Data Augmentation: Increasing the dataset size by incorporating more data samples can help improve the model's generalization capabilities.

These enhancements could contribute to building a more robust and accurate loan prediction model in future iterations.
